                        <h1>What is a <span className="txt-color">carbon footprint</span>?</h1>
                        <p>A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and methane) 
                            that are generated by our actions.</p>
                        <p>The average carbon footprint for a person in the United States is 16 tons, one of the highest rates in the world. 
                            Globally, the average carbon footprint is closer to 4 tons. To have the best chance of avoiding a 2â„ƒ rise in global temperatures, 
                            the average global carbon footprint per year needs to drop to under 2 tons by 2050.</p>
                        <p> Lowering individual carbon footprints from 16 tons to 2 tons doesn't happen overnight! By making small changes to our actions, 
                            like eating less meat, taking fewer connecting flights and line drying our clothes, we can start making a big difference.</p>
